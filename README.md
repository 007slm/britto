Britto
======

Britto a simple blog made with Meteor.
This is very much still work in progress still though.

Update
=======
Britto is undergoing a total rewite under this repository using [Stellar](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/stellar) which should be available in the main branch soon.
The only reason for not pushing this to the main is it currently doesn't support page transition effects like this version does.
All the development is happening in the Stellar branch with some notable changes like user management and blog rolls and so on there.


How to use
----------

To use Britto, you need to install Meteor:

    curl install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

Then you can clone the code onto your system:

    git clone git://github.com/jonathanKingston/britto.git

Move to that direcory and deploy to your own location:

    cd britto
    meteor deploy [yourlocation].meteor.com

You can then visit your applications address and login with username: admin and password: password.


Licence

This is using an MIT licence, I would paste it here but I am pretty busy with development right now.
